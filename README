The idea of the 3DMerge project was to take x number of 3d files with various regions defined that match up,
 then align the two 3d files to match one with another.

I couldn't get everything plugged together in time, so here's what I had working:

All the D-Level proficiencies were working, some C-level, and I needed to glue it all together. I probably won't have time to finish them before grades are due, so here's what I have for now.

With another 2-3 days I bet I could finish this project to 100%.
